<p class="header" id='clova'>Clova</p>
<p>The English name of Clova /kloʊ.və/ comes from the word 'clover', because it is refering to the vegetation of the planet, and frankly, clover is a nice word.
<p>Clova is a planet quite similar to Earth. About 75% of Clova's surface is made up of water. The remaining 25% of it's surface is land, consisting of archipelagos, continents, and islands. A day is 18 hours long. It orbits a star called <a class='highlight'>Hearth.</a></p>
<p>Clova has a circumference of about 18,500 miles. It's a bit rockier than Earth.</p>
<p>There are many different nations on Clova, for example <i>Engiman, Scant, Zabay, Kalicia, Laychan, Beau, Tayania, Borok, Karethia, Swithin,</i> and less officially, <i>Monuna.</i> (<a class='highlight'>The Korikian Union</a> refers to the nations Engiman, Laychan, and Zabay.)</p>
<p class="subheader" id='hearth'>Hearth</p>
<p>Hearth /hɚθ/ is the <a class='highlight'>red dwarf star</a> that Clova orbits.</p> 
<p>The name comes from the English word 'hearth', which refers to <a class='highlight'>the place infront of a fireplace</a>.
<div class="aSeparator"></div>

<p class='space'>spehs</p>
<p class="header" id='korikian'>The Korikian Union</p>
<p>The Korikian Union /kə.ɹɪk.iɪn/ refers to the grouping of Engiman, Laychan, and Zabay (called this because they are all located in the <a class='highlight'>Korikian Sea</a>). They are the three nations that speak english—albeit in <a class='highlight'>varied dialects</a>.</p>
<p>Despite it relation to where the country's are located, any country located in the Korikian Sea does not immediately become part of the union.</p>
<div class="aSeparator"></div>

<p class='space'>spehs</p>
<p class="header" id='beau'>Beau</p>
<p>Beau /boʊ/ is made up mostly of <a class='highlight'>forests, woods, and other vegetation.</a> They value nature and work over most things, and believe that <a class='highlight'>Clova is a goddess</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of people strongly dislike them, because they are what English speakers call <a class='highlight'>Elves</a>. They're usually a little taller than humans. They have <a class='highlight'>long pointed ears</a>, very pale skin, and chiseled angular faces. They speak a language called <i>Beau</i>, which is said to be the <a class='highlight'>most beautiful and smooth sounding language on Clova.</a></p>
<p>They are one of the only races known to produce <a class='highlight'>sorcerers.</a></p>
<p>Elve's lifespan is usually about 200 years.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='peaceKeeper'>Peace Keepers</p>
<p>(Elven) Peace Keepers /pis ki.pɚ/ are Elves sent from Beau to 'keep the peace' with other nations by doing favors for and helping the royals.</p>
<p class="subheader" id='silentWood'>The Silent Wood</p>
<p>The Silent Wood is a forest in Beau, about 60 thousand square feet in size. It is said that it is infested with monsters, which the monsters drove out or killed most of the peaceful creatures, making it eerily silent compared to other forests.</p>
<p>The elves—and other races—have attemped to de-monster the forest, though unfortunately they all failed.</p>

<p class="header" id='b&k'>Borok and Karethia</p>
<p>Borok /bɔ.ɹok/ and Karethia's /kə.ɹi.θi.ə/ geography is mostly flat rocky land, with a few patches of trees. They are two of the coldest and least densely populated countries on Clova.</p>
<p>They speak the same language. They are both on the same continent, and in fact were once one country. Though a civil war ended up dividing them into two territories.</p>
<p>The people who live in Borok are called the Boroki /bɔ.ɹo.ki/, and the people in Karethia are called Karethians /kə.ɹi.θi.ən/.</p>

<p>The geography of Engiman /en.dʒɪ.mən/ or /eŋ.gɪ.mən/ is mostly <a class='highlight'>lush fields and meadows</a>, with small woods sprinkled about and great rivers flowing through the landscape. Small villages are a common sight near rivers.</p>
<p>It is one of the biggest countries on Clova [about 3 million square-miles.] They speak English natively in an <span class='highlight'>accent similar to the <a href='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent'>mid-atlantic</a> accent.</span></p>
<img class='imgSmall' src='https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.0412e0f843cc602e07a879fbdcef2250?rik=FHsSliF9%2bqR4Iw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fistareforged.wdfiles.com%2flocal--files%2fl-theri%2fltheri2.jpg&ehk=2uXoQLmRtC4If9u7RKKY%2bH6as2AHhR6H9zyvivyhi%2bY%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0'>
<p>They are generally pale—although they <a class='highlight'>redden very easily</a>, whether it be from the sun, alchohol, or a strong emotion. They tend to have brown or blonde hair and brown eyes. There's a common stereotype that they have big noses, but whether or not this is factually correct is to be debated.</p>

<p class='subheader' id='caslogh'>Caslogh</p>
<p>Caslogh /kaz.loʊ/ is the city capital of Engiman. The Engiman castle is located here.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='dl&a'>Distance, Length and Area</p>
<p>Engiman uses four different distance/length/area measurement units:</p>
<p>League /lig/ (around 3.5 miles)</p>
<p>Double-Pace /də.bʊl peɪs/ (around 5 feet)</p>
<p>Pace /peɪs/ (around 2.5 feet)</p>
<p>Foot /fʊt/ (1 foot)</p>
<p>Finger /fiŋ.ɡɚ/ (around 0.8 inches)</p>
<p class='subheader' id='eqibrism'>Eqibrism</p>
<p>Eqibrism /e.kɪb.ɹi.ɪz.əm/ is main religion in all English speaking countries on Clova. People who follow the religion are called Eqibrists /ekɪbɹiɪst/.</p>
<p>In Eqibrism, there are two deities: Soll and Nocha. Soll /sɔl/ or /sol/ is the god of day, light, and peace, while Nocha /nəʊtʃə/ is the god of night, dark, and chaos. The religion is focused on balance between the two god's.</p>
<p>It is believed that after death, you are taken away to the High World, which is ruled by the two gods. When the gods are at balance, the High World changes to the perfect place for each individual person. Though if the gods balance were to crumble, the High World would turn into a prison and the mortal world would be split into a million pieces.</p>
<p>Religious leaders are usually healers as well.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='grey'>Grey</p>
<p>Grey /gɹeɪ/ is town nearby Caslogh. It is often seen as a extension of the capital.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='healerRobe'>Healer Robes</p>
<img class='imgSmall' src='https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/w/images/c/c4/Model-Choir_Robe-Male-Hyur.png'>
<p>Healer's robes are made from some of the finest cloth available. Any healer who wears a healer cloak is automatically respected by pretty much everyone around them—everyone from Engiman, anyway—because of the importance they play in religion and day-to-day life.
<p class='subheader' id='eHouses'>Houses</p>
<p>Engiman houses are traditionally made from wood planks or logs and stone bricks, supported by a frame of logs. Glass windows are common, though a lot of houses still only have shutters.
<p class='subheader' id='kingIlver'>King Ilver</p>

<p>Ogyri /oʊ.gaɪ.ɹi/ is a town in the south-west of Engiman, bigger than Wilhelm Hill. It is nearby a lake called Elqmoch.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='rEng'>Rural Engiman Accent</p>
<p>The accent is often shunned and called 'improper' by the upper-class Engimans.</p>
<p>Some differences between the standard Engiman accent include: /h/ is silent, /t/ is often /ʔ/ or silent, /ʍ/ is /w/, /aɪ/ is /ɑː/, and /eə/ is /ɛː/. 'You' is almost alway pronounced as 'ya', and slang is used a lot more often with speakers of this accent.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='eSurnames'>Surnames</p>
<p>Surnames are placed after given names. A surname is made up of two parts: the name, and the son/dohtor affix.</p>
<p>The name part comes from the father's name—that is, <a class='highlight'>unless the mother outranks the father</a>. If it's a son, they add the 'son' affix, and if it's a daughter, they add the 'dohtor' affix. For example: Heraldson, Rillendohtor, Juliason, Madriddohtor.
<p class='subheader' id='grimGuard'>The Grim Guard</p>
<p>The Grim Guard is the unofficial group name given to lower-ranking royal guards of Engiman, due to the fact they are underpaid and often mistreated by high-ups, understandably causinɡ 'ɡrim feelings'.</p>

<p><i>'When is the time?'</i> is slang for <i>'What time is it?'</i></p>
<p>Some words/phrases considered rude, albeit said quite commonly are: <i>imp</i> (as an insult), <i>dreath</i> [/dʒɹeð/ is an offensive name for a poor person, usually used by high-ranking rich people], <i>consarned, son of a gun, ruddy,</i> and—more rarely—<i>sard.</i></p>

<p class="header" id='kalicia'>Kalicia</p>
<img class='imgSmall' src='https://conworkshop.com/static/flag/KALC-be2d4867f96efb3ae9f21af7a03c2667fd5a6faa.png'>
<p>Kalicia /ka.li.ʃi.ə/ is a <a class='highlight'>remote island nation</a>, which the people there speak <a href='https://conworkshop.com/view_language.php?l=KALC'>Kalicien.</a></p>
<p>The Kaliciens are the race of people who live on the remote island of Kalicia, which is a society of scarce resources and recycling, mostly due to a horrible line of <i class='highlight'>ėn</i>. The main way they get food is hunting, though that is made even harder due to the fact many dangerous creatures lurk in the woods.</p>
<p>Kalicia—which is about <a class='highlight'>50 hectares of land</a>—is split into three territories. It is quite rocky and hilly, and it is filled to the brim with pine trees.</p>
<p>The Kaliciens have olive skin and (usually long and messy) dark hair and dark eyes. They average at <a class='highlight'>4'11" in height</a>, which is quite short. This could be due to generations of malnourishment from the difficult environment.</p>
<p>Since the Kaliciens don't have many valuable resources to trade with foreigners (+they are much too busy with civil dispute among the territories) they barely ever come into contact with outsiders. The result of this is that the Kaliciens have little to no outside influence.</p>
<p>Kalicien's value hunting-skill over most things. Usually they use spears and <i class='highlight'>aṅṙubasta</i> to hunt and defend themselves.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='anrubasta'>Aṅṙubasta</p>
<img class='imgSmall' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Danish-axe01.png/200px-Danish-axe01.png'>
<p>Aṅṙubasta /aŋɾubasta/ (meaning 'metal tooth') are a sort of long (normally 4-5 ft.) Kalicien axe that's commonly made from metal or stone and used for hunting and defense. Some aṅṙubasta are <a class='highlight'>double-sided</a>, although this is less common.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='en'>Ėn</p>
<p>Ėn /ən/ are what Kaliciens call their emperors. An ėn historically wears many types of <a class='highlight'>jewelry made from rare and valuable resources</a>, and wields a wooden staff with metal spear-head.
<p class='subheader' id='havestad'>Havėṡtad</p>
<p>Havėṡtad /ha.və.ʃtad/ is the main camp and or village of Kalicia.</p>
<p class='subheader' id='kNamSys'>Naming System</p>
<p>Given names for a Kalicien are not considered very important, often having simple and straight-forward meanings.</p>
<p>Surnames are heavily intertwined with a Kalicien's job/rank, and if their job changes, so does their surname. For example, if a Kalicien was named <i>Tioltes Irnuþisa,</i> then became the Empress, they would then be named <i>Tioltes Ėnisa.</i></p>
<p>When a Kalicien reaches the age of around <a class='highlight'>14-16</a> (usually depends on whether they are considered mature enough), they are legally an adult and are expected to work. Until then, they are not given a surname, and are usually referred to by only their given name, or in more formal or official circumstances, as 'son/daughter of _'.</p>
